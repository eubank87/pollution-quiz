# pollution-quiz

For this assignment I was asked to create a functional quiz game that launches when the start button is clicked. There is also a timer and penalties applied to the time if answers are incorrect. The user should then be asked for some input to save the score locally. Finally, the user will be re-directed to a high scores page where they can see past scores saved along with their own. 

I struggled to complete this assignment and unfortuantely not all pieces are functioning properly yet. Game play works (although styling could make user experience more enjoyable), the timer starts, deducts time for wrong answers, awards time for right answers and stops as game play and is collected as the score. User can input name and click save scores button, information shows as saved in local storage in console, but does not re-direct to the high scores html page properly or display saved scores. Additionally, deployed link is not functioning properly. Will need to refactor later.
